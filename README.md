# Kali-Windows-Dual-Boot-Tutorial
Step-by-step guide to create a dual-boot system using Kali Linux and Windows 10.

## Requirements:
- Minimum of 32 GB free disk space for Windows, and 20 GB for Kali Linux. Total of 52 GB minimum. **However I recommend much more than that.**
- CD-DVD/USB boot support.
- Kali Linux ISO image or Windows 10 installer image. For this example I will be starting out with a Windows 10 machine. **Starting with Windows 10 installation is easiest.**
- Disk imaging software like Etcher or Win32 Disk Imager
- Non-PXE system
  

## Step 1) Download and burn your desired disk image to either USB or CD-DVD:
1. Download Kali Linux Live image at https://www.kali.org/downloads/
2. Open your disk imaging software and select your USB or CD-DVD. Then select your disk image.
